# Deep-Learning-Specialization-AndrewNg-Notes ðŸ“”

I recently did the Deep Learning Specialization offered by deeplearning.ai in Coursera. The course was taught by Andrew Ng.
[Course Link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

In this repository I have compiled the digitally written notes which I have noted down while doing the course.
(_Apologies for my handwriting_)

The specialization consists of five courses:

1. __Neural Networks and Deep Learning__ - [_here_](https://github.com/ReboreExplore/Deep-Learning-Specialization-AndrewNg-Notes/blob/main/Andrew_Ng_NOTES_course1.pdf)
    - Brief Introduction of Deep Learning
    - Binary Classification
    - Logistic Regression
    - Cost Function
    - Gradient Descent
    - Computational Graph
    - Vectorization - covered in details
    - Activation Functions and their derivatives
    - Forward and Backward Propagation
    - Parameter Initialization
    - Building Blocks of Deep Neural Network (as a whole)
    - Parameters and Hyperparameters
2. __Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization__
3. __Structuring Machine Learning Projects__
4. __Convolutional Neural Networks__
6. __Sequence Models (not yet completed)__

The notes are written using a graphics tab in [Xournal](https://xournalpp.github.io/). 

*The notes no way serves as a replacement to the extremely wonderly course by Andrew Ng but only should be referred for revision of the original course content.*
