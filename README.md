# Deep-Learning-Specialization-AndrewNg-Notes

I recently did the Deep Learning Specialization offered by deeplearning.ai in Coursera. The course was taught by Andrew Ng.

In this repository I have compiled the digitally written notes which I have noted down while doing the course.

The specialization consists of five courses:

1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning 
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization
3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects
4. Convolutional Neural Networks
5. Sequence Models (not yet completed)

The notes are written using a graphics tab in [Xournal] (https://xournalpp.github.io/). 

*The notes no way serves as a replacement to the extremely wonderly course by Andrew Ng but only should be referred for revision of the original course content.*
